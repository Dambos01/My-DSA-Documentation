# My-DSA-Documentation

This marks the beginning of my portfolio-building journey, which I've undertaken alongside my Data Analysis class at the Incubator Hub.  


Through this experience, I've gained valuable skills in various tools, including MS Excel, PowerBi and SQL. Now, I'm excited to apply these skills to build a strong portfolio that showcases my abilities.

  -   What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?

  -   Which products have the highest number of reviews?

  -   How many products have a discount of 50% or more?

  -   What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0,4.0, etc.)?

  -   What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?

  -   What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200,₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
  -   How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
