# My-DSA-Documentation

This marks the beginning of my portfolio-building journey, which I've undertaken alongside my Data Analysis class at the Incubator Hub.  


Through this experience, I've gained valuable skills in various tools, including MS Excel and SQL. Now, I'm excited to apply these skills to build a strong portfolio that showcases my abilities.
