# My-DSA-Documentation

This marks the beginning of my portfolio-building journey, which I've undertaken alongside my Data Analysis class at the Incubator Hub.  


Through this experience, I've gained valuable skills in various tools, including MS Excel, PowerBi and SQL. Now, I'm excited to apply these skills to build a strong portfolio that showcases my abilities.
## Project Topic: Capstone project Amazon Product Review Analysis
### Project overview
I am working The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards,revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues.The CEO of Palmoria, Mr Ayodeji Chukwuma, is keen to address these issues before they get out of hand. The CHRO, Mr Yunus Shofoluwe, has been assigned the task to identify key areas within the business that could give rise to issues and address them immediately.Mr Shofoluwe decided to recruit me as an HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention. “Now, the future of gender equality in Palmoria lies in your hands” – the exact words of Mr Shofoluwe before he handed the data to me.

###  Explanatory Data Analysis 
-   The EDA involves exploring of the Data to answer some questions like:
-  Analysis Tasks
  -   What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments

  -   Show insights on ratings based    gender

  -   Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management

  -   A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000

  -   Does Palmoria meet this requirement?

  -   Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:

  -   How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000,etc.?

  -   Also visualize this by regions
