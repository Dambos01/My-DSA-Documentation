  ##  RESULT_FINDINGS
  -    I uncovered that the product with the highest number of reviews is the Amazon basics wireless (high_speed cable)with 853,946 rating point and 91-100% reviews,this gives us a feedback of user satisfaction.
  -   we also have the Toys and Games Category with the lowest Revenue, as it's a less demanded and highly dependent on the seasonal and August events.

  ##  RECOMMENDATION 

  -   I recommend strongly that Amazon companies should consider carrying out market surveys,using both primary data and secondary to make decisions that are satisfactory to its customers,Hence, increases the company's revenue.
  -   we understand that customers and pricing play a large role to translate available products into Revenue.

  ##  LIMITATIONS 
  -   One of the major limitations is seasonality in amongst many of the company's products
  -   Poor marketing strategies, and customer engagement.
  -   Customer Relationship Management Technology is bias and not properly optimized
